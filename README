This project will start a shell that you can run various commands in. When starting the shell
you pass in the name of a file to use as the 'filesystem', the extension .bin is automatically appended to it.
When redirecting input to the shell, it reads it correctly, but sometimes lines don't line up properly and 
I am so tired of working on this I'm just going to leave it as is. The same happened project 1

If any invalid commands/arguments are entered, an error message is displayed and your in-progress
command is discarded
